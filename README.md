# SmartHealth

Intelligent Healthcare Operations & Patient Engagement Platform — a backend built for MediNova,
a fictional healthcare network, as a structured engineering assignment.

The project is delivered in two parts:

- **Part A — Core Platform** (Weeks 1–3): patient/provider management, appointment scheduling
  with durable workflows, visit lifecycle, event-driven background processing, observability.
- **Part B — GenAI Layer** (Weeks 4–5): operational data ingestion and embeddings, semantic
  retrieval, an AI healthcare assistant, generated patient communication, streaming responses.

## Status

Requirements captured. Testing harness spine in place (see `tests/README.md`);
application implementation starts with Week 1.

## Tech stack

**Backend:** Python · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · NoSQL DB · Redis · Celery + RabbitMQ ·
Kafka + Schema Registry · Temporal

**Observability:** OpenTelemetry · Prometheus + Grafana · Jaeger

**GenAI:** LangGraph / LangChain · LLM provider (OpenAI / Groq / Anthropic) · Vector DB

**DevOps:** Docker · Docker Compose

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate     # Windows (Git Bash);  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 in PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate       # POSIX
pip install -e ".[dev]"

python -m pytest -m "not docker"    # fast tests, no containers

docker compose -p smarthealth-test --env-file .env.test -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d --wait
python -m pytest -m docker          # tests that need infrastructure
```

See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for the tier model and how to author a test case.
