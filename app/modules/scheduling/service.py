"""Booking operations. No FastAPI, no Temporal: activities and routers both call these.

Every function is idempotent, because a Temporal activity can run again after its
transaction committed but before the server heard it finished. Each detects that it has
already done its work and returns, without a second write or a second audit entry.

Every slot write increments `version` (PRD R-4) and happens in the same transaction as
the appointment write that justifies it (R-2). tests/meta/test_slot_writes.py keeps
slot-status updates inside this file.

The caller owns the transaction: these flush, the caller commits -- the Week 1 rule
(ARCHITECTURE §2.1), which is what lets an activity wrap one call in one unit of work.
